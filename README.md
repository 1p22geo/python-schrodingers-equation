# A Python script to solve the Schrodinger's equation in a 2D domain.
(spelled that wrong)

## Animations contained here:

gauss_empty.gif - a Gaussian wave packet moving across an empty potential function (no electromagnetic field, 0 gravity)

gauss_sin.gif - a Gaussian wave packet with a sine potential function.

gauss_step.gif - a Gaussian wave packet scattered by an upwards step potential

quadratic_down.gif - a wave packet in a quadratic gravity well

quadratic_down_2x.gif - a slightly offset wave packet in a gravity well, higher quality

quadratic_down_offset.gif - same, but offset on X instead on Y

quadratic_up.gif - a wave packet in an inverted gravity well (or an electromagnetic field of a simmilar sign)

quadratic_up_2x.gif - same, higher quality, longer animation.
