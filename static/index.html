        Schrodinger's equation - a journey of physics simulation

        This project is not finished yet. And it is definitely not yet compliant
        with realistic physics standards. At least, we tried.

      <h2 class="text-xl m-4 mt-8">Majorly misunderstood explaination</h2>
      <p class="m-8">
        According to a pretty modern theory, quantum mechanics, all matter in
        the universe is composed of tiny <code>particles</code>, the basic
        building blocks of the world. Now, we have something like a "periodic
        table" of particles. The standard model.

        But here's the thing. Particles are so small that we can't really
        measure where they are. And on this scale, when the particle size is
        noting compared to the uncertainty of its position (or momentum, for
        that matter), we cannot even speak of a certain "location" in space and
        time. And we can't just take better measurments in order to decrease the
        uncertainty. Because we have both position and momentum uncertainty. And
        measuring one of them will inevitably interfere with the other. So much
        that there is a special equation - the
        <b>Heisenberg Uncertainty principle</b>, linking those values together.

        If there is no certain location, then what is there? The naive answer
        would be: propability. But propability requires a finite number of
        possible states or values - <b>eigenstates</b>. Here, we have an
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable_set"
          class="hover:underline text-gray-700"
          >uncountable infinity</a
        >
        of them. We need an infinitely small propability for every one of the
        infinite points in space. And assigning a single propability to each
        point implies... a function. The <b>wave function</b> is an object
        closest to the position of a subatomic particle.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-xl m-4 mt-8">Properties of the wave function</h2>
      <p class="m-8">
        The wave function assigns a complex number to each point in space and
        time. The square of this value is the propability density. It is a
        finite number, not infinitely small. The propability of the particle
        existing in a given range of space is a definite integral of the square
        of the absolute value of the wave function.

        This is a typical wave-function-graph of an electron in a hydrogen atom
        at ground level. It is pretty straightforward that there is a higher
        chance of finding an electron where the square of the absolute value
        <code>(Re^2 + Im^2)</code> is higher. The real and imaginary part are
        separate, just for clarity. Later they will not always be (we will show
        phase and absolute).

      <p class="m-8">
        The potential function is another abstract concept. It is a value for
        the particle to interact with external forces and particles. Particles
        are atracted to places with a potential lower than their wave function,
        and repeled from places where their wave function is lower than the
        potential around them.

        This is the Schr√∂dinger's equation. It describes the evolution in time
        of the wave function (ùõô) based on the potential (V). We are solving it
        using <code>scipy</code> and <code>numpy</code> for arbitrary functions,
        some of which supplied by the user. That way we get an accurate
        representation of how particles move. Actually respecting quantum
        physics.

      <p class="m-8">
        1. Relativity<br />
        Our library simulates only <b>non-relativistic</b> quantum physics. And
        the only reason for that is... computation power. Not everyone has a
        computer capable of solving complex differential equations,

        2. Quantum field theory<br />
        We understand that when dealing with wave functions, there is no need to
        count individual particles, since they should be just written down as a
        single electron field, single photon field, and interacting with
        superposed quasi-particles. We understand that electrons either repel
        each other electromagnetically or emit photons. But here, we just
        focused on visualising all the quantum phenomena in a simple way,
        instead of implementing the tiniest and newest releases in difficult
        physics papers.

        kinda-realistic visualisations of most quantum phenomena, not complete
